                A well-known issue with generative AI is the huge amount of negative impact. One of the environmental impacts of generative artificial intelligence 
                is the limited supply of resources needed to create the hardware that runs it. <a href="references.html#ref1Env">(1)</a> Larger devices that run the AI in data centres run on GPUs 
                (Graphics Processing Units) which take rare raw materials to create the chips including silicon, copper and mercury. <a href="references.html#ref2Env">(2)</a> The amount of material to 
                make a computer needed in data centres is a staggering 800kg for a 2kg computer. This not only uses up non replenishable resources, but the mining 
                of these resources causes huge amounts of pollution and the spread of toxic waste. The creation of the mines also destroys huge amounts of natural 
                and causes deforestation and sinkholes. This is one of many environmentally impactful processes that making GPUs creates.

            <p>
               <a href="references.html#ref2Env">(2)</a> A solution to the huge number of natural resources consumed by AI may be able to be created if large data centre using companies 
               were legally required to disclose the sheer quantity to bring more attention to the matter and allow governments to implement 
               limitations. There are also some technological advancements that are being made which can improve the resource management <a href="references.html#ref3Env">(3)</a> 
               such as non-silicon chips.<br>
               The running of the large systems used in data centres also creates a by-product of heat which requires water cooling systems. 
               These systems run on fresh water which is already limited in the world. <a href="references.html#ref4Env">(4)</a> Many large data using companies consume staggering 
               amounts of water such as Google at 5 billion gallons in 2022 which is a huge increase from the previous year of 20%. <a href="references.html#ref3Env">(3)</a> The amount 
               of fresh water used to cool the generative artificial intelligence data centres is incredibly hard to justify when a quarter of the 
               world's population does not have access to clean drinking water.

            <p>
                <a href="references.html#ref5Env">(5)</a> Many data centres also rely on older technology to cool their servers, such as air-cooling systems which are even worse for the environment. 
                Air cooling works by elevating the servers and blowing cool air below the servers to cool them. The newer water cooling systems that 
                have been implemented are far better, being able to reduce the electrical consumption by up to 60% (through reduction of the current leakage effect) by pumping cool water specifically around 
                the warm chips within the servers, they are still far from good for the environment as they pose another challenge; the consumption of fresh water. 
                <a href="references.html#ref5Env">(5)</a> A solution to this problem would be to introduce environmental assessments any time a new data centre is to be created. These assessments need to have a 
                clear understanding of the future infrastructural impacts as well as the current consumption. Another improvement that could be made is to improve the 
                cooling systems currently in place to dramatically reduce the energy consumption of a data centre.

                <a href="references.html#ref6Env">(6)</a> By 2035 data centres could be using up to 20% of the world's energy usage. The huge energy requirements of generative artificial intelligence 
                are due to the process in making it. The way AI learns is through repeated training over weeks or even months which consumes huge amounts of power. 
                <a href="references.html#ref7Env">(7)</a> One way that the environmental impacts of artificial intelligence could be managed is through research into more efficiently training the artificial 
                intelligence. A huge amount of this energy is generated through use of fossil fuel based power generation methods which release greenhouse gases and 
                contribute to climate change. <a href="references.html#ref8Env">(8)</a> On top of this the huge energy consumption of artificial intelligence does not stop once the AI has been trained. The 
                inefficiency of artificial intelligence can make an internet search use around five times the amount of energy. <a href="references.html#ref9Env">(9)</a> The image generation software that 
                generative artificial intelligence is now capable of is also hugely energy consuming “Making two images can consume as much energy as charging a smartphone” 
                said Samia S Iqbal.

                <a href="references.html#ref9Env">(9)</a> The recent surge in popularity of generative AI has not only increased the energy consumption but also the technological advancements of artificial intelligence. 
                This continuous improvement of the hardware used by gen AI also makes older technology obsolete, meaning that every 2 to 5 years the data centre hardware will be 
                replaced, creating huge amounts of e waste (discarded technology that no longer has a purpose). Because very few countries have laws to enforce reuse or 
                recycling of e-waste it will very often end up in a land fill; continuing to affect the environmental impact of generative artificial intelligence.
                <a href="references.html#ref9Env">(9)</a> However, action is starting to be taken by some tech giants such as Microsoft and Google, who have both stated their goals to reach net zero waste and 
                emissions by 2030.

                All of this energy comes from many methods of electricity but by far the <a href="references.html#ref10Env">(10)</a> source for data centres is natural gas, 
                a non renewable source of energy that releases carbon dioxide when burned to produce energy. It is responsible for 40% of 
                the United States of Americas, one of the world's largest data centre markets, electricity used in data centres with only 24%
                    being from renewable energy sources. China also has a huge share in the data centre market and is even worse for the consumption 
                    of fossil fuels with around 70% of its electrical production for data centres being from coal produced energy and not even 20% 
                    being from renewables.<a href="references.html#ref7Env">(7)</a> One way that the environmental impacts of artificial intelligence could be managed is through research into more efficiently training the artificial intelligence.
