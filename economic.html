                In the grand scale of the economy, massive amounts of time, resources and consequently money are being put towards basic, 
                automatable tasks. For example, a study from Cornell University <a href="references.html">(1)</a> estimates that 84% of the 143 million complex transactions 
                conducted by the UK government are prime candidates for AI-powered automation. Using generative AI to perform basic tasks allows employees to focus on issues that require human intervention 
                or judgement, which would provide immense benefit to the economy.

                If implemented correctly, the speed that Generative 
                AI is able to perform simple, predictable tasks cannot be matched without significant investment into massive numbers 
                of highly trained staff. Additionally, Generative AI can streamline other aspects of work; summarising e-mails, assisting 
                with filling in paperwork and more- due to Generative AI’s adaptability, it can be used in many roles. <br><br>
                This flexibility can extend to the private sector as well; retail businesses have been implementing AI tools into their workflows. 
                The primary aspect that companies are pushing to automate is customer assistance. Due to the adaptable nature of Generative AI, 
                it is able to mediate basic requests from customers, allowing businesses to focus their customer service’s efforts on unique and 
                important problems. <a href="references.html">(2)</a>
            </p>

        <div id="column">
            <p>
                In addition to customer support, AI can be used to streamline customer’s interactions with a retailer, 
                whether it be online or in-person. Around 80% of consumers expressed interest in AI shopping assistance <a href="references.html">(3)</a>, 
                indicating that an AI assistant providing advice, directions and other information could be well-received. <br> The 
                benefits of this would be twofold; customers can leverage the knowledge of the AI to shop more efficiently, and retail 
                companies can use the data from the customer’s interaction with the AI to aid in planning; for example, if a large group of 
                customers start asking for specific products, the retailer can pass the information onto the supplier, and order products in 
                advance to avoid a shortage. Additionally, the nature of Generative AI means that these “companion apps” could become everyday 
                tools! For example, a shopping assistant could suggest recipes, drawing from information on the customer’s personal tastes, 
                schedule, deals and promotions from the store, and even sponsored products. Overall, the benefits of this approach are obvious.

                This model of interconnected AI assistants could be expanded to the workplace, 
                removing the workload associated with scheduling, coordination and productivity 
                monitoring. This frees up employees in middle management or supervising roles to provide 
                value to roles where humans are essential, such as sensitive internal HR operations.

                Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has boomed in popularity as one of the most influential inventions 
                in the 21st century. The effects it has already had are monumental, and while people still debate the scale 
                of the effect, it is showing massive potential in many areas of real-world applications. Unlike traditional 
                AI, which analyses and predicts, generative AI creates. Its potential to increase productivity, resource 
                optimization, and innovation are just a few examples. <br><br>
                Since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in late 2022, the first widely accessible Large Language Model 
                (LLM) or Generative AI, the idea of generative AI has moved from experimental technology to widespread 
                use across every industry. This study examines how generative AI has positively affected global economic 
                growth.

                The contributions AI has made to global economic growth can be seen in two main areas: productivity and innovation. The effects that AI has on productivity can range from supply chain optimization to task automation and many more. As per McKinsey & Company (2023), it is projected that artificial intelligence could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion each year to the global economy. Furthermore, this estimate has the potential to double if the integration of AI into existing software utilized for various projects is considered. This is larger than the entire GDP of the United Kingdom. (1) Similarly to this, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found that in 2016 the global GDP was around $75 trillion and that it was estimated to reach $114 trillion by 2030; however, AI could increase this by up to 14% or an additional $15.7 trillion. (2) AI is not just limited to optimization and can create new software or other new technologies, such as self-driving cars. This allows AI to not only grow the current economy but also create entirely new ones. All of this together means that the generative AI market is projected to pass $1.3 trillion by 2032 (4)
