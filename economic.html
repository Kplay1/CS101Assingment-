                In the grand scale of the economy, massive amounts of time, resources and consequently money are being put towards basic, 
                automatable tasks. For example, a study from Cornell University <a href="references.html">(1)</a> estimates that 84% of the 143 million complex transactions 
                conducted by the UK government are prime candidates for AI-powered automation. Using generative AI to perform basic tasks allows employees to focus on issues that require human intervention 
                or judgement, which would provide immense benefit to the economy.

                If implemented correctly, the speed that Generative 
                AI is able to perform simple, predictable tasks cannot be matched without significant investment into massive numbers 
                of highly trained staff. Additionally, Generative AI can streamline other aspects of work; summarising e-mails, assisting 
                with filling in paperwork and more- due to Generative AI’s adaptability, it can be used in many roles. <br><br>
                This flexibility can extend to the private sector as well; retail businesses have been implementing AI tools into their workflows. 
                The primary aspect that companies are pushing to automate is customer assistance. Due to the adaptable nature of Generative AI, 
                it is able to mediate basic requests from customers, allowing businesses to focus their customer service’s efforts on unique and 
                important problems. <a href="references.html">(2)</a>

        <div id="column">
            <p>
                In addition to customer support, AI can be used to streamline customer’s interactions with a retailer, 
                whether it be online or in-person. Around 80% of consumers expressed interest in AI shopping assistance <a href="references.html">(3)</a>, 
                indicating that an AI assistant providing advice, directions and other information could be well-received. <br> The 
                benefits of this would be twofold; customers can leverage the knowledge of the AI to shop more efficiently, and retail 
                companies can use the data from the customer’s interaction with the AI to aid in planning; for example, if a large group of 
                customers start asking for specific products, the retailer can pass the information onto the supplier, and order products in 
                advance to avoid a shortage. Additionally, the nature of Generative AI means that these “companion apps” could become everyday 
                tools! For example, a shopping assistant could suggest recipes, drawing from information on the customer’s personal tastes, 
                schedule, deals and promotions from the store, and even sponsored products. Overall, the benefits of this approach are obvious.

                This model of interconnected AI assistants could be expanded to the workplace, 
                removing the workload associated with scheduling, coordination and productivity 
                monitoring. This frees up employees in middle management or supervising roles to provide 
                value to roles where humans are essential, such as sensitive internal HR operations.
