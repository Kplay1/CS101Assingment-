                This research has been conducted to learn about the usage of generative 
                AI in hospitals and healthcare, and to investigate how generative AI can 
                be used to increase efficiency within medical establishments, maximising the number of
                patients processed by healthcare establishments.   
                    Some uses of AI that will be explored include:              

                <ul>
                    <li>How AI is being used to improve the experience and treatment of those who are patients within the healthcare system.</li>
                    <li>How generative AI can be used to monitor and analyse patients' conditions. </li>
                    <li>The improvements of quality of life for the staff working in these establishments.</li>

                    The purpose of this case study is to investigate how generative AI is aiding humanity in working towards 
                    and achieving United Nations (UN) goal number 3: good health and well-being.<br>
                    Generative AI is being used to aid in the creation of personalised treatment plans;
                    through the use of AI as a tool for analysis of substantial amounts of data, information can be analysed
                    to find patterns between treatments, allowing the patients more effective, efficient and satisfactory
                    treatment.<a href="references.html">(1)</a><br>Generative AI is not a bad thing, as some people believe,
                    and in reality, it can be majorly beneficial in the medical field, making sure patients get the
                    best treatment for them.

                    It is well known that working within hospitals and healthcare can be a difficult and draining job, and so
                    the fact that generative AI can be used to reduce the exhausting workload of the staff who work vigorously
                    within these clinics is very beneficial! It has also been documented that through the use of
                    Generative AI to create draft responses to their clients' emails, experts within the medical report reduced stress. 
                    This will lead to a recution in burnout.<a href="references.html">(1)</a> <br>
                    Nurses are a crucial part of the healthcare system, but it is known to be a very-hard going job, and that there
                    is always need for more of them. A quote in relation to this states "Gen AI demonstrates the potential to
                    enhance patient care, optimize workflows, and advance nursing education and training." <a href="references.html">(1)</a> <br>
                    From this we can see that generative AI could be a major help to the staff within these work environments in many
                    ways which will also help improve overall satisfaction of patients.

                Diagnosis is a very important and complicated topic within the medical field; AI's ability to assist with this is invaluable.
                Maleki Varnosfaderani states: "By harnessing the power of AI, healthcare professionals are now equipped with tools that provide 
                deeper insights into patient data. This could help lead to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans." 
                This can help to reduce the number of mistakes and improve the accuracy of the professional's diagnosis.<a href="references.html">(2)</a> <br>
                There is only so much that hospitals and health clinics can do for their patients, 
                but the satisfaction of anyone who has used healthcare is very important to the health and 
                wellbeing of everyone in society. This is yet another area in which generative AI can improve results; Maleki Varnosfaderani claims 
                that "The focus is on three key areas: AI-powered wearable devices for continuous monitoring, the impact of virtual nursing 
                assistants, and AI’s role in telemedicine and remote patient engagement.". <a href="references.html">(2)</a>

                <p>
                    The safety of patients within healthcare is another extremely important subject in which generative AI can be 
                    beneficial such as how Bajwa J, Munir U, Nori A and Williams B state that "AI could be applied to the remote monitoring of patients 
                    (e.g. intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration."
                    <a href="references.html">(3)</a>
                    This can be exceedingly practical and important for doctors and patients as keeping track of patients’ conditions 
                    could help prevent the condition from worsening without anyone knowing about it.

                Another fantastic way that Generative AI can be useful in health care is in the form of a chatbot. 
                It allows patients the ability to ask medical question and creates a more engaging environment for 
                these patients and to help make it easier to communicate with them. It also gives these patients the 
                opportunity to take a bit more control over their own health and potentially encourages these individuals 
                to become more responsible for their health and well-being <a href="references.html">(4)</a><br><br>
                As discussed previously, efficiency within hospitals is an important goal to tackle and generative AI can be a 
                great solution to this. Improving how the patients interact with generative AI is another key topic as by implementing the correct tools, 
                multiple issues can be tackled at once within hospitals for example: "Gridspace [36] is an enterprise 
                solution powered by generative AI that automates patient outreach by handling phone calls, answering questions, 
                and performing administrative tasks."<a href="references.html">(4)</a> <br><br> and "Gridspace can triage and direct patient inquiries in real-time, 
                providing valuable insights. Its applications exemplify the potential of Generative AI in transforming patient 
                interactions, streamlining administrative processes, and enhancing overall healthcare efficiency and patient 
                satisfaction."<a href="references.html">(4)</a>

                    It may come as a surprise but generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT could be very important to countries that aren’t as 
                    developed and don’t have as effective healthcare. This is because generative AI can provide reliable health information 
                    in local languages, this will help people in more remote or underserved areas better understand their symptoms therefore 
                    better understand the treatments they will need. Generative AI tools can also help people in areas where healthcare workers 
                    are scarcer, the tools can help by providing first level triage or mental health support. A Stanford University report 
                    states that “Eleni Linos, MD, DrPH, the director of the Stanford Center for Digital Health, spends a lot of time thinking 
                    about how digital tools, including generative AI, could tackle health problems that humans haven’t been able to solve.” 
                    <a href="references.html">(5)</a> This is because generative AI can handle more complex and large scale data intensive problems.

                     In areas where doctors are scarce generative AI will be able to generate medical records and even diagnose from things like images, 
                     symptoms and voice inputs. They can even offer things such as 24/7 virtual support. In Kenya the Jacaranda Health’s PROMPTS is a system 
                     that provides answers to pregnant and postpartum patients, the AI is trained in multiple languages and has faster response times, this 
                     is backed up by the source saying “One of the most widely scaled examples we highlight in the report is Jacaranda Health’s PROMPTS system 
                     in Kenya. PROMPTS is a two-way SMS-based maternal health service that provides timely, AI-generated responses to questions from pregnant 
                     and postpartum patients. Since integrating a custom-trained AI model in Swahili and English, the system has significantly improved response times – 
                     from hours or days to just minutes.” <a href="references.html">(5)</a> This means Kenya will be able to overcome the shortages of healthcare workers and will also improve 
                     the safety of mothers and babies through early detection and faster responses. Also, in Kenya they are using an AI called Genki that is analysing 
                     X-rays for tuberculosis, The Healthcare Radius states, “Genki analyzes chest X-rays within a minute to automatically triage tuberculosis (TB) 
                     suspects.” <a href="references.html">(6)</a> This is good as traditional diagnostic methods can take a considerable amount of time especially if the X-rays need to be sent to 
                     a radiologist, with Genki it reduces the time significantly. This means patients with TB are detected much sooner and early detection for TB is crucial.

                    Gaining access to basic health care can be trickier and more challenging in different parts of the world such as rural communities and small villages, people 
                    would have to travel far distances to seek medical support which can be more costly for them. Having a tool, you can easily access and can ask seek advice 
                    from and ask questions can be very useful for these people in more rural areas. AI is able to help countries that have slow or expensive drug access, they 
                    do this by designing new drugs that are more cost efficient and then they are able to simulate the effects of the drugs without doing long lab trials. They 
                    are able to generate custom formulations that are based on regional diseases and the available resources, they can also support local scientists create vaccines 
                    faster and cheaper. Generative AI is assisting countries in the African region as it is able to track and predict the outbreaks of dangerous diseases as stated 
                    here “Employing AI in community medicine has emerged as a valuable tool for disease epidemiology. For instance, researchers have utilized this approach to forecast 
                    outbreaks of dengue fever, as well as to track and predict the spread of influenza.” <a href="references.html">(7)</a> The source then goes on to state “Such initiatives showcase the 
                    potential of AI in aiding public health efforts to monitor and manage communicable diseases more effectively in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries).” <a href="references.html">(7)</a> 
                    This shows the impact that Generative AI is having on these less developed countries by helping them deal with diseases more effectively.

                <p>
                    Malaria is a very dangerous disease and is becoming easier to diagnose due to generative AI, deep learning techniques are being used to diagnose people 
                    automatically as stated here “Malaria is a life-threatening disease that is spread by the Plasmodium parasites. It is detected by trained microscopists 
                    who analyse microscopic blood smear images. Modern deep learning techniques may be used to do this analysis automatically. The need for the trained personnel 
                    can be greatly reduced with the development of an automatic accurate and model.” <a href="references.html">(8)</a> This will help in less developed areas where clinics may lack the diagnostic 
                    labs or patients may go untested or even get misdiagnosed. Generative AI is being used to discover new malaria drugs much faster and more efficiently than traditional 
                    methods, the source states “Artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing either structure-based or ligand-based approaches, has demonstrated highly accurate performances in 
                    the field of chemical property prediction.” <a href="references.html">(9)</a> Typically scientists would find new medicines by testing lots of chemicals in a lab to see which would kill malaria 
                    parasites which can take years and cost millions but with this deep learning model called DeepMalaria it is able to predict which new molecules are most likely to 
                    kill malaria and it does this in seconds, it can also repurpose existing drugs if the model predicts they might also work against malaria.
