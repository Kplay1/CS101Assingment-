                This research has been conducted to learn about the usage of generative 
                AI in hospitals and healthcare, and to investigate how generative AI can 
                be used to increase efficiency within medical establishments, maximising the number of
                patients processed by healthcare establishments.   
                    Some uses of AI that will be explored include:              

                <ul>
                    <li>How AI is being used to improve the experience and treatment of those who are patients within the healthcare system.</li>
                    <li>How generative AI can be used to monitor and analyse patients' conditions. </li>
                    <li>The improvements of quality of life for the staff working in these establishments.</li>
                </ul>

                    Generative AI is being used to aid in the creation of personalised treatment plans;
                    through the use of AI as a tool for analysis of substantial amounts of data, information can be analysed
                    to find patterns between treatments, allowing the patients more effective, efficient and satisfactory
                    treatment.<a href="references.html">(1)</a><br>Generative AI is not a bad thing, as some people believe,
                    and in reality, it can be majorly beneficial in the medical field, making sure patients get the
                    best treatment for them.

                    It is well known that working within hospitals and healthcare can be a difficult and draining job, and so
                    the fact that generative AI can be used to reduce the exhausting workload of the staff who work vigorously
                    within these clinics is very beneficial! It has also been documented that through the use of
                    Generative AI to create draft responses to their clients' emails, experts within the medical report reduced stress. 
                    This will lead to a recution in burnout.<a href="references.html">(2)</a> <br>
                    Nurses are a crucial part of the healthcare system, but it is known to be a very-hard going job, and that there
                        is always need for more of them. A quote in relation to this states "Gen AI demonstrates the potential to
                        enhance patient care, optimize workflows, and advance nursing education and training." <a href="references.html">(3)</a> <br>
                        From this we can see that generative AI could be a major help to the staff within these work environments in many
                            ways which will also help improve overall satisfaction of patients.

                Diagnosis is a very important and complicated topic within the medical field; AI's ability to assist with this is invaluable.
                Maleki Varnosfaderani states: "By harnessing the power of AI, healthcare professionals are now equipped with tools that provide 
                deeper insights into patient data. This could help lead to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans." 
                This can help to reduce the number of mistakes and improve the accuracy of the professional's diagnosis.<a href="references.html">(4)</a> <br>
                There is only so much that hospitals and health clinics can do for their patients, 
                but the satisfaction of anyone who has used healthcare is very important to the health and 
                wellbeing of everyone in society. This is yet another area in which generative AI can improve results; Maleki Varnosfaderani claims 
                that "The focus is on three key areas: AI-powered wearable devices for continuous monitoring, the impact of virtual nursing 
                assistants, and AI’s role in telemedicine and remote patient engagement.". <a href="references.html">(5)</a>

                <p>
                    The safety of patients within healthcare is another extremely important subject in which generative AI can be 
                    beneficial such as how Bajwa J, Munir U, Nori A and Williams B state that "AI could be applied to the remote monitoring of patients 
                    (e.g. intelligent telehealth through wearables/sensors) to identify and provide timely care of patients at risk of deterioration."
                    <a href="references.html">(6)</a>
                    This can be exceedingly practical and important for doctors and patients as keeping track of patients’ conditions 
                    could help prevent the condition from worsening without anyone knowing about it.

                Another fantastic way that Generative AI can be useful in health care is in the form of a chatbot. 
                It allows patients the ability to ask medical question and creates a more engaging environment for 
                these patients and to help make it easier to communicate with them. It also gives these patients the 
                opportunity to take a bit more control over their own health and potentially encourages these individuals 
                to become more responsible for their health and well-being <a href="references.html">(7)</a><br><br>
                As discussed previously, efficiency within hospitals is an important goal to tackle and generative AI can be a 
                great solution to this. Improving how the patients interact with generative AI is another key topic as by implementing the correct tools, 
                multiple issues can be tackled at once within hospitals for example: "Gridspace [36] is an enterprise 
                solution powered by generative AI that automates patient outreach by handling phone calls, answering questions, 
                and performing administrative tasks."<a href="references.html">(8)</a> <br><br> and "Gridspace can triage and direct patient inquiries in real-time, 
                providing valuable insights. Its applications exemplify the potential of Generative AI in transforming patient 
                interactions, streamlining administrative processes, and enhancing overall healthcare efficiency and patient 
                satisfaction."<a href="references.html">(9)</a>
