                <br><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
                Overall, our group worked fairly well. Despite initial setbacks at the beginning, with Caiden and Archie being ill, we feel that we have
                produced a model website. Despite the polish of our final product, we have identified some key areas that we could have improved on.
                We feel that we should have made a more thorough initial plan, as it needed to be re-drafted after we handed it in.<br>
                Additionally, we feel that our communication was lack-lustre. Due to our method of splitting the group between Website Developers (Tom, Archie) and 
                Content Re-Structurers (Sean, Caiden, Finn), we had a period where the Website Developers were waiting for finalised content, which led to a degree of stress,
                because some of the Content Re-Structurers were spending time with family. The image opposite shows our order of operations throughout the project.<br><br>

                <b>Initial Plans & Research Phase</b><br><br>
                As the project began, Tom assessed the skills of the group. He felt that he and Archie were well-suited to work on web development, and that Caiden, Sean and Finn
                would make a good team to work on consolidation of Research Material into Finalized Content for the page.<br>
                The group initially split into three sub-groups, with Tom and Archie researching economic impacts, Sean and Caiden researching medical benefits, and Finn researching 
                the enviromental impacts of generative AI. We did this because we felt that subdividing the groups would prevent one person having to organize everyone's research. Within 
                these sub-groups, we decided our specific topics, and ensured that no two people would be researching the same thing. After this, we split up and worked through our research in these sub-groups.
                The graph opposite shows the flow of communication   in this stage of the project.

                <b>Research Hand-Over</b><br><br>
                After we had all completed our research, we re-organised our group into the aforementioned Web Development and Content Re-Structurer/Research Consolidation groups- 
                The relevant communication flow diagram is opposite.<br>
                This group structure allowed the parallelization of website development and research consolidation, allowing the group to work more efficiently. Despite this, 
                the website development team reached a point where they needed content to put into the website before the research consolidation team was entirely finished. To mitigate
                this, we decided to hand over the finished portions of the content to the web development team, and continue to work in paralell- this can be seen in the "Partial Content Hand-Over"
                node in the order of operations chart.

        <div class="column">
            <p>
                <b>Content Implimentation & Reference Consolidation</b><br><br>
                When the website development team recieved the partial content, they elected to split the work; Tom would put all of the content into the site, find images and build the reference page as
                he went, and Archie would work on the reference linking system and other complex elements, such as the nav page highlighting and JavaScript tweaks.<br>
                As the web development team worked, the research consolidation team finished the organisation of their references and tied up all of the loose ends, and handed over the completed content.
                Tom then went to work finalizing each page.

                <b>Final Tasks and Checks</b><br><br>
                After the medical, environmental, economic and explaination pages were finished, we performed multiple checks over the entire site, weeding out spelling errors, mis-labelled sources and every
                other error we could find. Additionally, we ensured that the site scaled correctly, and worked in a variety of browsers.<br>
                While Tom was ensuring that every page would pass through the W3Schools CSS & HTML checkers, Finn wrote up a large amount of information for the Activity Log page. Tom then completed the final write-up,
                and after one final check, we feel ready to hand it in.
